This needs the following packages (on Fedora):

	freealut
	mesa-libGL (or any other OpenGL implementation)
	mesa-libGLU (or any other OpenGL GLU implementation)
	openal
	SDL
	SDL_image
	SDL_ttf
	sqlite

Note that you'll want the -devel versions to compile:

	(freealut-devel, mesa-libGL-devel, etc...)

No "make install" currently provided.  Just do a make and then
run the executable in place.  "make run" is provided. :)

OS X: make -f Makefile.osx will create a DMG
